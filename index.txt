About Me
I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at University College Dublin, Ireland, specializing in molecular magnetism. I completed my PhD at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal. My doctoral research focused on the study of single-molecule magnet behavior in Ln(III)-based polyoxometalates (Ln-POMs). Specifically, I investigated how to tune the symmetries around Ln(III) metal centers using polyoxometalates as inorganic ligands to encapsulate these centers. I have also worked on Ln(III)-POMs based photoluminescence, as well as photo- and electro-catalytic applications of polyoxometalates. Apart from POMs, I also examine metal-radical complexes to understand the exchange interaction between metal-radical and radical-radical centers. My ultimate goal is to utilise the unique characteristics of POMs surrounding 3d or 4f metal centers for magnetic and catalytic applications.
